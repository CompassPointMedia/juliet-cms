* Employee Hour Logs
	Ability for single employee to log into the console
	Create List View of employees
	Create List View of employees' hours this week/month/year (Mostly for editing, probably the best way to do it)

* Have the slide-show be self-upgrading; e.g. for Anne Wait + others
* Probably, the biggest thing is integration of dataobjects to the focus view as I've done with GC on at least one interface; shunting the sql query

DONE need to improve the top nav and make all links work including adds

* the hours feature works like follows (hours.php)
	if hours are present that's what total is, NOT the hours diff
	but normally the hours will be based on timer - they need to turn timer off and manually enter prev. dates otherwise
	once they change the hours the timer goes off
	if timer is off and they enter two dates, as soon as this happens the first time the total fills and it only happens once
	on submission
	000= error
	001= OK
	010= error
	011= back fill start
	100= error
	101= back fill end
	110= create total
	111= error ? doesn't sum up

* new classified - invoice data not pulling over right
* new member - not yet clean on companyname and clientname
* classified - need fetchMemberCardData() onchange of the list
* orders.php - customer list wonky and needs improved
			 - use account needs filtering
			 - interlock against opening an invoice in cash sale and vice versa
* save and new not working on classifieds.php now

* a BIG GOAL is to integrate the dataset query into the FOCUS view as well as the current sort and etc. for the ids
* export data from dataset needs column filters
* RTE_JoinDate - needs field formatting and error checking on receiving end - ALSO IF IT COULD BE A DROPDOWN/CHECKBOX THAT WOULD BE GOOD
* cookie hold last selected tab

2009-06-10
----------
* up to now I have had several cases where the focus view utilizes the filters and sort of the list view; however with the recent changes in the filterGadget, these are obsolete; INTEGRATE FILTERS AND SORT INTO THE FOCUS VIEW for that dataset
* overview of members.php
  -----------------------
	1. this interface is all about the CLIENT table, the client is the primary key.  Clients-specific items:
		a. Statuses_ID - for the client (company)
		b. ResourceToken - if we need adhoc relationships
		c. Company Name and quickbooks specific items
		d. NOTE HOWEVER
			* WholesaleAccess is tied to the addr_contacts table
			* _ContactsAccesses is tied to the addr_contacts side
			* the client address nodes are Address1|2-City-State-Zip-Country + (Shipping)Address1|2-etc.
			  the contact address nodes are HomeAddress.. and BusAddress
			  (remember that finan_invoices has ShippingAddress|2 + BillingAddress)
			  you can see the compatibility issues here
	2. eventually I want to have the ability for 8-8 rlx to pass both Clients_ID and Contacts_ID and show the contact on the tab, and use iframes to refresh between members of a company
* things needed for members.php
	5. settings - change password
	6. assign accesses and ADD accesses

DONE	mode=sort passes directly -> mode=refreshComponent w/o break -- really the component itself should handle its own sort by the query string so that we only pass
	mode=refreshComponent&component=[component]&sort=[colname:recognized_in_component]
	
	and it takes it from there
	
* components/comp-24 - heading toward generic I found that I needed to simplify the whole system.  I have uncovered a major shortcoming in the var datasetTable - since the "table" could be any combination of tables based on what's needed for cols and search and abilities (editability, deletability)
* "Email" in whereclause ambiguous on the search - how do I overcome this?
* here is the sequence I saw that I need to have stable:

	statuses
		set a search in place
		clear a search
		SEARCH HELP IN THE WIKI
		make sure statuses are stable and even have setting to create the status table if needed - NEED A MOST CURRENT INSTANCES DATABASE!!!!
		save search 
	sort
		clean up the query string, make truly generic
	set active/inactive = MOVE TO 3-LEVEL STATE VS 2
	add
	edit
	**** NOT DONE?? delete
	ability to override the filterMemberQuery
	ability to have the window be a popup (subset of clients)
	list of what I need for this branch to work for a database
	settings available to change this branch



* need to export single order
* need to remove/show shipping and add orders based on moduleConfig array settings
* need to hide dropdown list for items if !adminControls[editOrders]
