minor improvements, NEXT MAIN PROJECTS will be the following:
	get mail feature internal and working
	make preview more sensible, have it not record a batch, etc. etc.
	make a list of THINGS to do which are yet deficient
	-- one of the most important things to do after this is work on the file manager and file explorer - integrate windows look with web-ap functionality

OK so at about 11:52 I got the mailer sending out and to multiple groups.  The priorities are (and can be found in todo also):
	1. the mail sending interface is user-unfriendly - need progress bar
	2. compiling needs tested but
		a. doesn't get white space right
		b. case - sensitive anywhere ?
		c. docs on it for the help section
	3. help needs activated
	4. need a "yes" confirm
	5. review needs to work in a better method - without looping through in the same way
	6. for groups, really need a function INGROUP('Deep 6 Crew') and NUM_GROUPS() and GROUP_POSITION('Deep 6 Crew')
	7. need a way to say "this person from this group was mailed something on this day" - thus opening path for a timeline
	8. 
	
	Appearance: gradient at the top with letters in white, nice envelope graphic as well.  Cancel becomes close, and probably move save and cancel to upper right.  I've got a drawing of what the sender should look like

OK so I 've started with the ability to do multiple groups.  Since groups can be a part of groups, the logic is going to have some complexity.  I think it'd be better just to develop a list of id's and then use the records from there.  The goal for now is to send out the USER information only 

I'm going to have to study and undertsand that user vs. groups join query - 

At some point we need to have a value of "groups you are in" which is a list of sorts, and also when mailing to a single group, be able to list the head of the group, and what the INDIVIDUAL'S TITLE IN THE GROUP IS.
