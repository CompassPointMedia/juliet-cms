# README #

I'm working through the process of moving sites over to git and eventually an OOP platform.  This is Winged Republic and it was a pretty good instance of my Juliet Project CMS.  

### What is this repository for? ###

* Coding-only without /functions /components and /images/i and a few others which are better considered "vendor" features
* Version 0.2 (first one was Fantastic Shop)

### Where is the project going from here? ###

This is version 0.2.  The objective is to have the site completely flexible based on the content in the CMS database, the /Library folder (which contains CSS), and the images folder.  That being the case, we're cetainly a long way from a very meaningful site as this layout would be good for 2006 but not today.  But if I can pull over my remaining Juliet sites using this code and have them functional immediately, then I've saved some time and I have a proof of concept to be moved into say a Laravel Framework.  Then I implement responsive templates, angular and a good backend upgrade and I'll have something perhaps worth taking to the next level.


### Important points ###

* The code is based on the database being self-contained (on the old server all Juliet sites depended on a master database called relatebase_rfm
* Passwords are located in a file `../private/config.php` completely outside of the repo.  My decision has been to have passwords and sensitive information completely outside the folder structure of the repo.
